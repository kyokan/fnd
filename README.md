# go-ddrp

DDRP is a protocol for synchronizing small amounts of data across a decentralized network. Its goal is to create a global, decentralized, and permissionless data commons that allows everyone to store and retrieve data from any node on the network.

This repository contains the protocol's reference implementation in Go.
